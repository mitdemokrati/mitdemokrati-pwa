# TODOs

## Before release

- Fix parsing party konklusion bug with split party votes (chop up string before parsing me thinks)
- Create install flow and prompt

## Eventually

- Think of a good way to trigger list refresh
- Create detail-view of single afstemning
- Rethink list-view of afstemning
- Rethink layout

## Whenever

- Get a handle on what's gone wrong with the covid19 data changes, stemmelist cannot be trusted
